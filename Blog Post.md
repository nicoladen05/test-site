When transitioning from handwriting notes to typing them on a keyboard, many people have a hard time formatting their notes to make them look similar to their handwritten notes. Writing in bold or cursive text, creating a table or even typing complex equations are tasks that can be easily accomplished when using a pen and paper, but when trying to do these widespread document creation software like Word or Google Docs, many people find themselves either clicking through various menus or learning a large amount of keyboard shortcuts.

The solution to this is creating your notes in Markdown. Markdown is a document format that provides various benefits over using common formats. First of all, Markdown works in the same way as a normal text file, which means it can be easily opened by a wide range of programs, including a standard text editor like Notepad.

Knowing this, you might wonder: How can I format my notes when they are essentially just text? Great question! Instead of storing formatting in a - often proprietary - file encoding, Markdown uses normal characters to denote things like headings, tables or bold text. Instead of creating a heading by changing various settings for your font size and style, you can simply just type a `#` and append your heading. Adding more `#`, like `###` creates a sub-heading on the third level. Another thing you'll find yourself doing often is creating bold and cursive text. To make your text cursive, just add a `*` infront and behind of your desired text. Similarly, adding two `**` will create bold text. There's a ton more ways of formatting notes, but I'll leave it up to you to discover them. You can find great cheat-sheets online, that serve as a nice summary of all the available formatting.

Now reading a file like this as normal text is pretty hard, since you have to know all the available formatting to understand them. But this is were apps come in to help. There are a lot of different apps to create and display markdown files using easily readable formatting. And since Markdown is basically just a text file, all of these apps are compatible with each other, so it doesn't really matter which one you choose. That being said, I would recommend Notion or Obsidian for starting out. Both of these apps can be used straight away, but Obsidian offers a lot more customization later down the line. These apps also both have a so called "Slash-Menu", which allows you to execute a list of commands by simply typing a `/` in your note. If you, say forget how to create bold text, you can just type `/bold` and press enter to get the `**` automatically inserted into your document. Finally, you can also use both of these apps to create links to other notes in the text, similar to sites like Wikipedia. This allows you to create a linked system of notes and help improve comprehension of the topics you are taking notes on. 

So, should you switch to Markdown right now? If you are interested in learning a new system, go for it. Learning Markdown is pretty simple, as it's just the surface of efficient notetaking. However, this also makes it tempting to learn other Markdown-languages like LaTeX or groff and also improve the efficency of your note-taking. If you already have a working system, and don't want to learn everything new from scratch, you should honestly just stick to the system you know.
